# JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF)

The JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is a standard extension to the
Java platform that lets you take advantage of standard services to:
determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to
it; discover the operations available on it; and instantiate the
appropriate bean to perform the operation(s).

See the
[JavaBeans Activation Framework web site](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jaf/).
